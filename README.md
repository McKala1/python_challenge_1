##McKala's Fancy Palace

## Overview 

* This is the first python project I have ever done! It was super fun, and I loved throwing my own twist on the code to make my menu unique and reflect me. 

* First, I typed out my take on a food menu. This was super fun because I got to express myself while coding python for the first time. I made four different categories in my menu dictonary, they are "Appetizers, Entrees, Drinks" and "Dessert".

* Second, I set up two lists, one is called "my_list = []", and "order_list = []". Then I launched the store and presented a greeting to the customer that looks like the following "print("Welcome to the McKala's Fancy Palace. ")". Then I wanted the customer to be able to order from the menu multiple times so I created a continuous loop that looks like the following "place_order = True". Then I hit enter and added a "while loop" that looks like the following "while place_order". Within the while loop I included a statment to ask the consumer which menu they would like to order from. I also included a couple "if" and "else" statments to pull the customers order from the order list, and included statments along the way to ensure consumer that they are in fact ordering items along with their price. 

* Third, I created a "try" and "except" statment to check if the consumers input was correct or not. I just made it so that if they mess up a prompt will pop up stating their input item was not on the menu, and to restart the program. Then created another "while loop" and had my "keep_ordering" input to ask the consumer if they want to keep ordering off the menu or not. After this, there is a match, case sequence I did to complete the final order for the consumer. With this there is a "True" or "False" for the "place_order" code to ask the consumer to finish their menu order. 

* Lastly, I played around with the spacing to make sure "my_variable_item_name", and "my_variable_price" fit perfectly in the chart that shows the consumer their final menu order. This was fun because I made a "for" loop that looped through the items in the consumers order. This included the items name, price, quantity, and total cost. Then I wrapped everything up with a couple print statments on line 254, and 260 that stated the total cost with their actual total costs in US dollars.
